  |   Horizon Chase Turbo presents Barry Leitch, the musician behind the    |
  |   soundtracks of classic racing games Lotus Turbo Challenge, Top Gear   |
  |   and Rush.                                                             |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Release notes:                                                        |
  |                                                                         |
  |   We decided to name our release Horizon_Chase_Turbo_XCI_NSW-SUXXORS    |
  |   because we thought the lack of a tag was confusing considering the    |
  |   very same game was essentially pred 9 months ago by VENOM             |
  |   (Horizon_Chase_Turbo_eShop_NSW-VENOM). Without the XCI tag it made    |
  |   it like it was another game or a brand new game. It is not.           |
  |                                                                         |
  |   The titleID is different, but the game is identical to the eShop      |
  |   version, so if you already have the eShop version with its latest     |
  |   update, this release probably is not for you.                         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   From now on, if we ever decide to release another XCI version of an   |
  |   eShop game already pred, we will add the XCI tag. Specially           |
  |   considering there are tools to convert NSP to XCI and XCI to NSP      |
  |   anyway. Keep in mind the fact it's a retail XCI doesn't make it any   |
  |   safer than a NSP converted to XCI, so be careful if you think         |
  |   Nintendo won't ban you because you are mounting this XCI instead.     |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Otherwise, enjoy I guess if you are a collector or missed this        |
  |   amazing game 9 months ago!                                            |
